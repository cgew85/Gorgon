# Gorgon
## A small app to manage your movie collection

This app uses a MongoDB hosted over at mlab.com. It runs on Java 8, Spring Boot and Gradle.

If you want to give it your own shot you need to change the settings in the application.properties file
and supply your own credentials via your IDE such as username and password.
